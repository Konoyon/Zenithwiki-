{{Character|name = Blade Master|image = blade_master_idle_800x.gif|imagecaption = Blade Master}}The '''Blade Master''' class imbues their bodies and weapons with [[Essence|essence]] to augment a lifetime of physical combat training. Using their abilities and skills, they can overwhelm their opponents with physical onslaughts, shield their party members, or even support them with [[Heal|curative abilities]] and [[Buff|passive effects]].
The Blade Master uses two weapons to execute skills using physical gestures. Some skills require both swords, while others are executed with just one. Combat feels fluid, strategic, rhythmic, and fast-paced -- almost dancelike. Like all other classes, the Blade Master can play all three classic roles (Support, [[DPS]], and Tank).

You can view current abilities by looking at the [[Godstone]] menu. You can actively change your role at any time between Support, [[DPS]], and Tank, by selecting one of the different icons on the left side of the Godstone menu. The first time you make this switch will set your abilities so that you only know the basic skills of your new role. Advanced skills for that role can be unlocked. The previous roles you played as will still keep the skills you had in that role.

== Lore ==

highest levels. Blade Masters are a highly trained group of dual 
wielding experts. [[Rin the Ram | Rin the Ram]] is a very notable Blade Master and the head of the Blade Master Academy.

! align="left" |<h2>Support</h2>
|-
"'''support them with curative abilities and passive effects'''" <br/>
Support is meant for players who like helping rather than being the person at the front dealing the primary damage. 
Support players may grant temporary buffs to teammates, such as more health, higher damage, or faster mana regeneration. 
They may also heal their teammates when damage is taken. <br/>


Dash: The support Blademaster dash creates a shield in an [[AOE]] around the end of each dash. This shield is very powerful because it seems to equal the targets health. <br/>



<!--==Abilities==

*'''Passive Ability: Dash''' - Blade Masters have the ability to dash in the direction they are facing. The ability has two charges, each taking 8 seconds to recharge. 
*'''Essence Drain''' - Sword is charged above head, deals damage to enemy. As the name suggests, it drains their natural essence, weakening them. 
[https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9108/1145/files/Essencedrain-1.mp4?v=1614736172 Essence Drain Video]
*'''Knockback Slash''' - Sword is charged above head, upon hitting the enemy, damage is dealt and enemy is pushed back.
[https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9108/1145/files/Knockbackstrike-5.mp4?v=1614736258 Knockback Slash Video]
*'''Final Strike''' - Dual sword attack, two red lines follow the blade upon contact with enemy, dealing large amounts of damage. 
[https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/9108/1145/files/Finalstrike-2.mp4?v=1614736294 Final Strike Video]
== Mechanics == 
* Blocking: By crossing the two swords, the player can block enemy attacks. 
* Slice: By slicing a sword around an enemy's shield/sword, damage will be dealt upon contact with the enemy's body. Blade Masters also have the ability to slice through projectiles, shown here: 
* Spells/Moves: Basic attacks are done using the right hand, slashing in the direction of the bright red indicators. The brighter the red lines glow when you slash with your light saber, the more damage you do. Timing is everything.
* Damage Calculation: Damage will be calculated based on a few factors, such as the length of your swing, speed of your swing, and strength of your swing.
