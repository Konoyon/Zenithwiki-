For a guide on how to play Essence Mage, check out [[Essence Mage Guide]].

An Essence Mage draws on [[Essence|Essence]] to create and shape the elements and reality to their will. Essence Mages are characterized by their trademark wing-like Essence Amplifiers which help essence mages focus their power. 

Contrary to what some might assume, Essence Mages, like any class in Zenith, can fit any role within a party, whether playing as a DPS, Tank, or Support.

<blockquote>From a young age, promising candidates are selected from the general population of Zenith to undergo this strict training. The learning of the way is strictly regulated, as it relies on hidden teachings that can only be discovered outside of the city. Unlike citizens of Zenith, essence mages spend a large part of their teenage years learning how to manipulate essence outside of Zenith, and so they interact with both Zenitheans, as well as the wandering, nomad clans of the borderlands. Because they lead such cloistered lifestyles but share so many experiences normal citizens never see, they are at once more knowledgeable and more sheltered.

'''''~Excerpt from the [[Zenithean Archives]]'''''

Some say there is a training academy that is nestled deep within the Forest, accessible only by mages, and warded by magic to prevent discovery by [[Amarite|Amarites]].

DPS is a class meant for those seeking to deal high damage. As an Essence Mage DPS player, you will have spells available focused on dealing damage, for example, Lightning Strike. 
===Lightning Strike===
Cast down a bolt of lightning in a [3m] area, dealing (60 + 220% ATK) damage. Also generates a large amount of stagger.
'''How to cast:''' 
To cast a lightning strike you use the grab button while reaching up then you pull down. An aiming circle will appear on the ground and signify where the lightning will land. You can let go of the lightning at any time to have lightning strike wherever the circle is at the time. You move your hand up to make the circle go further away. So far my experience has been that it doesn't have a cooldown.

'''How to cast''' 
You can cast blazing barrier by reaching your hand across your chest and pull across. This will summon an aiming circle similar to the lightning strike will appear and you can move your hand up to make the circle go further away.

Support is meant for players who like helping rather than being the person at the front dealing the primary damage. Support players may grant temporary [[Buff|buffs]] to teammates, such as more health, higher damage, faster mana regeneration. however the main focus of most support classes is to [[Heal|heal]] their companions upon damage taken. The base attack for the support essence mage is called aether spark which is bullets of essance that can heal their companions or hurt opponents. 
=== Aether Spark ===
