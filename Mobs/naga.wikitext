Nagas are hostile and cunning creatures who often attack in packs. Corrupted Essence enhances their powers and they attacked many people during The Fracture. 
They are a race of snake people, they are formidable enemies if you are un-prepared however their attack patterns are fairly simple. 
They can be found deep in a cave inhabited by the exiled and there is a boss in the very back of the cave. 
The boss is a very large purple Naga that has both melee and AOE attacks.
