"During The Fracture, a force called Corrupted Essence spread throughout the land and infected creatures and humans alike. 
People in Zenith who were touched by this Corrupted Essence were subsequently exiled from the city. 
Many of the Exiled migrated to new lands or formed their own communities. 
There is an aggressive minority of Exiled who still harbor resentment towards Zenith and they seek vengeance against the city."
