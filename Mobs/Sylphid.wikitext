'''Sylphids''' are low level creatures that live outside of the [[The City of Zenith|City of Zenith]] in the [[Fractured Plains]]. They are aggressive, and due to being infused with too much [[essence]], have lost the ability to communicate with humans. 
"These unfortunate creatures were once humans who were eventually depleted of their natural Essence. They are mutated husks of their former selves who operate on pure instinct, indiscriminately attacking humans who wander into their territory."
