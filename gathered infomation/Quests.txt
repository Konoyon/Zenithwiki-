She's the One for Me!
 Hey fellow Zenithian! I am a procurer of all things rare, which I then sell for profit and, well, I have a strange request from a customer that I'm hoping you can help me with.

Could you scout around the edges of the forest here and see if you can find me three "Cloak of Amara" flowers? They are purple flowers with a green stem. Very rare, very valuable.
Myth has it that when Amara was imprisoned in this planet, pieces of her majestic cloak scattered around the world and where they landed, a strange, purple flower grew! In fact, If you listen closely, when you approach a Cloak of Amara, you can hear her cloak flapping in the wind as she fell.
